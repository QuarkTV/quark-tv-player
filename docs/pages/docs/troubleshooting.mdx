## Common Issues

### Video Not Playing

If the video isn't playing, check the following:

1. Verify that your API key and library ID are correct
2. Ensure the video ID exists in your Bunny Stream library
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Verify that HLS.js is supported in your browser

```tsx
// Example of correct initialization
const client = new BunnyStreamClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  libraryId: 'your-library-id'
});
```

### Playback Errors

If you encounter playback errors:

1. Check your network connection
2. Verify that the stream URL is accessible
3. Ensure your browser supports HLS playback
4. Check if the video format is supported

### Quality Selection Issues

If quality selection isn't working:

1. Verify that multiple qualities are available for your video
2. Check if the quality options are properly configured
3. Ensure the player has loaded completely

```tsx
// Example of quality configuration
const config = {
  qualities: [1080, 720, 480, 360],
  defaultQuality: 720
};
```

### Styling Problems

For styling issues:

1. Check if your CSS variables are properly defined
2. Verify that styles are being loaded correctly
3. Inspect the DOM to ensure classes are applied
4. Check for any CSS conflicts

```css
/* Example of correct CSS variable definition */
:root {
  --media-brand: #9147ff;
  --media-focus-ring: #772ce8;
}
```

## Debugging Tips

### Console Logging

Enable debug logging to get more information:

```tsx
<QuarkTVPlayer
  debug={true}
  onError={(error) => console.error('Player error:', error)}
  onStateChange={(state) => console.log('Player state:', state)}
/>
```

### Network Analysis

1. Use browser DevTools to inspect network requests
2. Check for any failed requests to the Bunny Stream API
3. Verify that HLS segments are loading correctly
4. Monitor WebSocket connections for live streams

### Performance Issues

If experiencing performance issues:

1. Use lazy loading with Next.js
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Check for memory leaks

```tsx
// Example of lazy loading
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const QuarkTVPlayer = dynamic(
  () => import('@quarktv/quark-tv-player'),
  { ssr: false }
);
```
